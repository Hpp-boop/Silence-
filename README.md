# Silence-
I'm sure that we all have seen silence as something calm and constructive. So many of us are the one where we put silence in vigorous pain that we suffer. Not having freefom to express our emotions whether we are angry, disappointed, sad, satisfied, love . 
Every element of emotion starts to sob us with guilt of " why i hadn't conveyed at that time , things might be different as what is today 'A complete mess' ". But we forgot that the mess is our life that we have lived throughout. 
As the time will pass our emotion will regain the stability ,as for some ,time may give more scratches than stitches that is they might be  living in past. 
Silence shouldn't be treated like this where we suffer to the most. At last we will eventually gain the wisdom to control things where we can by efforts rest should be leaved on their own.
